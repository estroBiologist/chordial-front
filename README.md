# chordial-front

**chordial-front** is a WIP Godot-based frontend for the [**Chordial**](https://github.com/estroBiologist/chordial) audio synthesis engine, built using Godot 4 and **godot-rust**.

this frontend is *extremely WIP*, with many features being outright mockups and placeholders, and the only part of the program with any real functionality being the Node View. you've been warned.
